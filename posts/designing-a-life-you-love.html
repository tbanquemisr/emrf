                <p class="post__description">
                    A reflection on aligning daily routines with long-term dreams, plus the questions I
                    revisit every season to make sure my calendar reflects my priorities.
                </p>
            </header>

            <div class="post__body">
                <p>
                    The first step in designing a life you love is to decide what belongs in it. Not in
                    the abstract, but in vivid, calendar-level detail. My template starts with three
                    pillars: creative output, deep relationships, and consistent learning. Everything I
                    say yes to should ladder up to one of these three.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every quarter I schedule a personal review day. I open my journal, map the
                    commitments that shaped the previous months, and compare them to the intentions I set.
                    The goal isn't to judge myself for mismatches&mdash;it is to observe the gap with curiosity.
                </p>
                <h2>Questions that guide my review</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>What energized me most in the past season? What drained me?</li>
                    <li>Where did I ship meaningful work? Where did I stall?</li>
                    <li>Which relationships did I invest in? Who do I want to spend more time with?</li>
                    <li>What am I learning that excites me enough to keep going deeper?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These reflections feed into a planning session where I design experiments. Sometimes
                    they're small: batching meetings into one afternoon. Other times they're bigger:
                    blocking a weekly "studio day" with no notifications and a single focus. The key is to
                    treat each change as a hypothesis instead of a permanent switch.
                </p>
                <h2>Build from the calendar up</h2>
                <p>
                    To keep myself honest, I translate every priority onto the calendar. Creative work
                    becomes focus blocks twice a week. Relationship building becomes a recurring dinner
                    with friends. Learning shows up as a Saturday morning study club with my favorite
                    coffee and a stack of books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing a life you love is never finished. It is a living document that adapts as
                    you do. The win is not achieving a perfect schedule&mdash;it's staying in conversation with
                    what matters most.
